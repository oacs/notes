### Writting a paper step by step

1. Make fleeting notes
2. Make literature notes
3. Make permanent notes
- When creating permanent notes we should think how this information relates with what we already had
    - Permanent notes can relate to other notes as:
    - Adding new information
    - Supporting information
    - Contradicting information
    - Merge with other ideas to create a new one
4. Link your notes
- All permanent notes need to be linked
5. Choose your topics and questions within your research, use what you have to see whats missing or waht you need to know
- Don't hang on to an idea, if something interest you, switch to what atracts your attention
6. Choose what you want to write base on your permanent notes
- Use what you have, fill the blanks and focus the narrative
7. Make a draft using your permanent notes, take care of your argument, what you want to transmit, does it have holes that you need to fill?
8. Review it, Share it, Celebrate! and most important continue with other paper

Raw | Literature -> Permanent -> Draft -> Paper

Read/Investigate -> We gather ideas/notes -> We polish the info -> We glued together -> We make a paper

We don't need to know what its going to be the end goal on writing, we can't know for sure unless we already have a big picture

### Let the work carry you forward
We should avoid forcing us to put energy on what we are writing and instead the writing should be our fuel, we should let the excitement of our curiosity shine

### Tools need it

- Inbox
- Slipbox
- Reference System / Link Resolver
- Editor
