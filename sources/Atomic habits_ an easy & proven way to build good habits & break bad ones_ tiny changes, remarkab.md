## Bibliography
Atomic habits: an easy & proven way to build good habits & break bad ones: tiny changes, remarkable results 
## Notes

### Focus on the trajectory
We usually tend to bully ourselves for the current state we lived in, instead we should focus on what we are doing to make a difference, how I see my self it defines me as a person

We are never satisfied with who we are, we need to be in peace with the system that we develop to become better, in Atomic habits they focus on that a person is the sum of their actions, having a hollistic approach on how we manage our habits to become the person we want to be

### Goals can be your enemy
Setting up goals is not a bad thing, but the way we approach to them could be an issue, James Clear refers to 4 problems with goals:
 - Winners and losers share the same goals, so having a goal is not the pre-requisite to be a winner
 - Achieving a goal can give us a false feel of success, it dosent matter that you clean your room if you don't have the habit of keep it clean
 - Hoping that happinnes will come after we reach our goals is a mistake
 - Goals can contradict long terms values, after you hit a milestone we could think that we need a break but this deflects the porpuse of creating solid habits that last
 
### Self awerness is the key to change
The first step to change something is to understand whats happening, the author instiates that the life cycle of a habit is:
- Cue: the first stimulus that remind us of something
- Craving: the need that surges after the cue to do something about it
- Action: the action we do to safistfy the craving
- Reward: how we feel for reaching that dopamine after resolving our need

### Habits are tied to what, when and where
The habits that the person tells itself to do it at a concrete time and at a spific place, will be more likely to do it, the pointing and calling behaviour improves the probability of success that we stick to the habit of that we do the task that we planned to do

### How to start an habit
#### Implementation Intention
> *"When \[**Situation**\] arises, I will perform \[**Action**\]"*
> *"I will \[**Behaviour**\] at \[**Time**\] in \[**Location**\]"*

#### Habit Stacking
Is the action of stacking a new habit after a current habit, a current habit could be just a simple thing that we do everyday, for example, getting to bed, make breakfast. This can also be used to stack multiple habits together, one after another.
> *"After \[**Current Habit**\] I will \[**New Habit**\]"*

This technique follows the principle of [[The Diderot Effect]]

It is important to stack habits that are attached on the sameway, for example, if you want a new habit that happens everyday, then you need to paired with a older habit that happens everyday

You need to setup your new habit for success, find the right moment to do it

> \*\*Note: this also works for putting new habits between older habits
