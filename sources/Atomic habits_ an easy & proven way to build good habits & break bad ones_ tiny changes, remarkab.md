Atomic habits: an easy & proven way to build good habits & break bad ones: tiny changes, remarkable results 
## Notes

### Focus on the trajectory
We usually tend to bully ourselves for the current state we lived in, instead we should focus on what we are doing to make a difference, how I see my self it defines me as a person

We are never satisfied with who we are, we need to be in peace with the system that we develop to become better, in Atomic habits they focus on that a person is the sum of their actions, having a hollistic approach on how we manage our habits to become the person we want to be

### Goals can be your enemy
Setting up goals is not a bad thing, but the way we approach to them could be an issue, James Clear refers to 4 problems with goals:
 - Winners and losers share the same goals, so having a goal is not the pre-requisite to be a winner
 - Achieving a goal can give us a false feel of success, it dosent matter that you clean your room if you don't have the habit of keep it clean
 - Hoping that happinnes will come after we reach our goals is a mistake
 - Goals can contradict long terms values, after you hit a milestone we could think that we need a break but this deflects the porpuse of creating solid habits that last
