**Summary**

### Bibliography
Getting things done: the art of stress-free productivity 
## Notes

### Mind like water ðŸš°
the author provides a mindset where anything that comes to the mind needs to be written down
so we can free up our mind and focus on one thing,
we need to write all the actions that our brain is telling us to do,
treating our mind as a RAM, meaning that our brain is designed to store information for small periods of times and that it doesn't make sense to try to keep in our mind complex steps of things that we need to do,
and that the way to do this is writing our tasks in a inbox section

### Trust your system
It is important that we trust the system we build upon because if we know that the system is
not working there's no way that our mind can behave like water, something that its bothering
us is going to keep bothering us around and we can't find that nirvana of focus on a task

### You don't manage priorities, YOU HAVE THEM
It is important that we focus our energies on the things that we can control, and those are
the actions that we do towards the things that we need to do

### The Five Stages of Mastering Workflow 
> We (1) **collect** things that command our attention; (2) **process** what they mean and what to do about them; and (3) **organize** the results, which we (4) **review** as options for what we choose to (5) **do**

1. Collect
2. Process
3. Organize
4. Review
5. Do

> The quality of our workflow management is only as good as the weakest link in this five phase chain

### 1. The Collection Success Factors ðŸ§º
> 1. Every open loop must be in your collection system and out of your head
> 2. You must have as few collection buckets as you can get by width
> 3. You must empty them regularly

This tool should be something natural that you do the same way as you do your toothbrush on the morning or when you finish something to eat, it should be an activity that it is part of yourself

This idea goes well with the statements on [[Atomic habits_ an easy & proven way to build good habits & break bad ones_ tiny changes, remarkab|Atomic Habits]] because the author want us to have this behavior inside of our core self

#### Collect everything
Anything that comes to your mind of an action that our-self thinks that we need to do, it should be writing down, the author refers to this ideas as **Open Loops** 

#### Few collection as posible
Ideas can come at any time or place, for example a good idea that could be attached to work can come when you walk by on the park, so it is important to have a way to capture ideas without having them to be deeply coupled to contexts or buckets

The amount of collections should be something manageable, should have a quickly access to add notes and to view them so you can clean that list, more of this on the next section

#### Empty the bucket regularly ðŸª£
If you don't clean this list is the same as having a trash system that is never pickup from the trash-man you will have at the end a bunch of buckets with amorphous ideas, that might don't even relate one to another

### 2. Process

#### What is **It**?
The things that we put on our todo list might don't even have clear form or action so we need to first check what's the thing that we need to do to mark this item as finished( this might not me always the case)
#### Is **It** Actionable?
In case that the answer is no, it could go to one of these three places:
1. Trash, nothing to do or no longer need it
2. Someday/Maybe: no action is need it in the moment but it could be something that we might want to do on the future (incubate)
3. Reference: it is something that might have valuable information that we want take a look on the future (reference)

> The author refers to a project, any open loop that has more than a couple of steps to complete it

In case that it is actionable we need to check if it is a project related and ask us "What outcome have you committed to?" and "Whats the next action required?"

The **Next Action** refers to the next physical and visible activity that we need to do to move forward the current status of the completion of the task we want to finish

The author suggest that a weekly review to the projects should be more than enough to check if an action is still valuable and make it fresh until it is completed or eliminated
