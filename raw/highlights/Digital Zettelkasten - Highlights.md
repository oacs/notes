# 10. How to read

As you read, make fleeting notes. The "best" way to do this is to physically take notes while you're reading: Highlight things and write in the margins or in a separate notebook

--------------------

Once you've exported your highlights, review them and highlight, once again, the parts of those highlights that are the most interesting. This is a mental energy management technique: When you were reading the book, you were more focused on reading it, not on thinking deeply about whether or not a passage was useful. Now as a separate task you're asking yourself which parts are interesting enough that you want to re-write them in your own words later.

--------------------

The educational psychologist Kirsti Lonka compared the reading approach of unusually successful doctoral candidates and students with those who were much less successful. One difference stood out as critical: The ability to think beyond the given frames of a text (Lonka 2003, 155f). Experienced academic readers usually read a text with questions in mind and try to relate it to other possible approaches, while inexperienced readers tend to adopt the question of a text and the frames of the argument and take it as a given. What good readers can do is spot the limitations of a particular approach and see what is not mentioned in the text.

(Tiago Forte calls the highlighting of highlights "progressive summarization.")

--------------------

Look at the highlights of your highlights and re-write the interesting ones in your own words. You're now turning your fleeting notes into a literature note. It's okay not to summarize every highlight. Only worry about the information you most want to learn or that you can foresee wanting to use in the future.

--------------------

The archivist asks: Which keyword is the most fitting? A writer asks: In which circumstances will I want to stumble upon this note, even if I forget about it?

--------------------

Now take only the most interesting ideas from the literature notes, and turn each into individual permanent notes. Permanent notes should have one idea per note

# Digital Zettelkasten_ Principles, Methods, & Examples
## Metadata
* Author: [[David Kadavy]]

## Highlights
The best thing about phrases is you're able to tell what the note is about from the filename, as seen in search results or a link to the note from another note. — location: [555]() ^ref-24519

---
this method forces you to think more about each note, deciding how it fits within the context of your work. The final good thing about Folgezettel is as you view a note, any adjacent notes in your list of filenames are related to that note. — location: [590]() ^ref-55223

---
You might never do anything productive with your Zettelkasten because you’re always experimenting with file-naming conventions. — location: [621]() ^ref-27337

---
Choosing the right keywords or tags for your Zettelkasten allows it to work as a non-hierarchical database of your knowledge and ideas. — location: [628]() ^ref-31848

---
create keywords based upon patterns you see, which inform theories you’re working on. — location: [637]() ^ref-5569

---
A finished screenplay represents, obviously, 100 percent of its author’s creative labor. The vast majority of this work, 75 percent or more of our struggles, goes into...creating the climax of the last act. — location: [641]() ^ref-41269

---
Choose keywords that are specific to an idea, and unique from generic ideas. — location: [639]() ^ref-14275

---
If two notes share the same tag, I will only link the two if they are especially relevant to one another. — location: [669]() ^ref-39447

---
Should they be both linked and tagged (and, if applicable, share the same ID)? This is a rhetorical question for you – there’s no right answer. — location: [665]() ^ref-65113

---
If you aren’t careful, maintaining a Zettelkasten can feel like a lot of work. — location: [677]() ^ref-7940

---
The four main contexts around which I’ve designed my own rituals are: active, lying down, reclining, and upright. — location: [682]() ^ref-45101

---
Generally, I reserve my computer time for linking, tagging, and organizing notes; I summarize fleeting notes while reclining; I read while lying down; and I take fleeting notes while active. I also access my notes in various stages from my phone while waiting in lines, at restaurants, or in waiting rooms. This context is especially good for highlighting my highlights from a book. — location: [695]() ^ref-16551

---
The point of a Zettelkasten is to turn your notes into completed writing. The act of note-taking helps solidify knowledge in your mind, while developing miniature rough drafts you can turn into completed writing. — location: [707]() ^ref-58493

---
I use my tag index as a starting point. I rearrange the index according to how an article might flow, then I re-write from scratch in a separate document. — location: [720]() ^ref-12961

---
choosing to include too much metadata can slow down your processes and make maintaining your Zettelkasten feel like a chore. — location: [728]() ^ref-25202

---
The metadata you include in your notes helps narrow your searches in the future, and/or speed up your writing process when you create completed work. — location: [727]() ^ref-15286

---
Experiment with different amounts of metadata. As you retrieve and work with notes, notice what information you find yourself fetching regularly. — location: [749]() ^ref-34035

---
You probably won’t build the perfect Zettelkasten from the start. — location: [757]() ^ref-33630

---
See where the sticking points are in your workflow, and refer back to this book if you need help. (If you struggle with perfection paralysis, I have a book for that: The Heart to Start: Stop Procrastinating & Start Creating). — location: [759]() ^ref-52918

Retain what you read: No more forgetting what a book was about the moment you finish reading it. The Zettelkasten method helps break reading down into a series of engaging rituals that repeatedly expose you to the most interesting things you've read – thus helping you retain what you read. Retrieve it quickly: No more fumbling through pages to try to find that passage you want to reference. With your digital Zettelkasten, you can copy and paste the exact quote in seconds – along with bibliographic information, if you choose to record it. Know what to read next: Your Zettelkasten helps you follow your curiosity in a productive way. If you're looking for something to read, you can look in your Zettelkasten to see what sparks your interest. Whatever you choose, exploring that topic will drive your writing projects forward. Develop your ideas: Instead of starting each writing project with a blank page, you already have written short passages you can stitch together to create an instant first draft. Have ideas: Because your Zettelkasten frees your mental energy from having to remember and retrieve things you read or wrote long ago, you have more mental energy available to think about new ideas. The act of organizing your notes is just enough a challenge to spark new ideas without burning yourself out. — location: [181]() ^ref-30320

---
Fleeting Notes: Notes you take "on the fly." Literature Notes: Condensed notes of an entire article, book, etc. Permanent Notes: Notes summarizing a single idea. These are assigned keywords and linked to other notes. — location: [348]() ^ref-33262

---
Books: As I read an ebook, I make highlights (fleeting notes). I later export those highlights to plain text and keep them in my "Inbox," so I know they need to be processed. I condense those highlights into a literature note. I make permanent notes for each of the most interesting ideas. I store the highlights I exported in my "Raw" folder. Conversations: Over dinner, a friend tells me about an interesting story. I make a fleeting note in my pocket notebook. I later look up the story, and make a permanent note about it. Podcasts: While listening to a podcast, I hear a great quote. In a notes app on my phone, I jot down a rough timecode, and a two-word description of what the quote is about. I later re-listen to that part of the conversation, and capture the exact quote in a permanent note. — location: [366]() ^ref-60660
