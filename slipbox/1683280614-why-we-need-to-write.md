## Notes

Writting notes help us with the main work that we need to do (Reading and thinking)
it help us to put on own words what we understand of think,
it prepare us for the future, in case that we want to revisit something

> “Notes on paper, or on a computer screen [...] do
> not make contemporary physics or other kinds of
> intellectual endeavour easier, they make it
> possible,”
