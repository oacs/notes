### ACCESS
Access is a folder structure that tries to close the gap between action and knowledge and to  take advantage of the two systems of categorizing the information(Links and Folders)

### Structure
- [[Access Folder Structure#Atlas|Atlas]]
- [[Access Folder Structure#Calendar|Calendar]]
- [[Access Folder Structure#Cards|Cards]]
- [[Access Folder Structure#Extras|Extras]]
- [[Access Folder Structure#Sources|Sources]]
- [[Access Folder Structure#Spaces|Spaces]]

### Sources
