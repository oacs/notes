## Notes

## ACCESS
Access is a folder structure that tries to close the gap between action and knowledge and to  take advantage of the two systems of categorizing the information(Links and Folders)

### Structure
- Atlas
- Calendar
- Cards
- Extra
- Sources
- Spaces
#### Atlas
It helps to gather and group the knowledge that I own, here can go basically any high order notes that I use to group information for example:
- Maps of Content(MOC)
- Overviews
- Dashboards
