## Notes

### ACCESS
Access is a folder structure that tries to close the gap between action and knowledge and to  take advantage of the two systems of categorizing the information(Links and Folders)

### Structure
- [[Access Folder Structure#Atlas|Atlas]]
- [[Access Folder Structure#Calendar|Calendar]]
- [[Access Folder Structure#Cards|Cards]]
- [[Access Folder Structure#Extras|Extras]]
- [[Access Folder Structure#Sources|Sources]]
- [[Access Folder Structure#Spaces|Spaces]]

### Atlas
>It's the map to your world of knowledge
>It helps to gather and group the knowledge that I own, here can go any high order notes that I use to group information and to help me navigate to it, for example:

- Maps of Content(MOC)
- Overviews
- Dashboards

### Calendar
Here we keep track of all the information that is tied to time, for example:
- Journals
- Plans
- Reviews
- Daily Notes

### Cards
Its the same as the Slipbox from the [[cards/Zettelkasten|Zettelkasten]] method, here we store all the ideas or permanent notes that we have and can be categorized as:
- Things
- Knowledge
- People

>I don't group by any folders, I love that I can trust my Atlas to navigate through my knowledge

### Extras
Its the source where we have the attachments that we need for our notes:
- Multimedia
- Templates
- Manuals
- Excalidraw

### Sources
Its the literature notes where we base our knowledge, where we gather the sources that I use for my notes:
- Books
- Articles
- Videos
- Courses
- Podcasts

### Spaces
Here we organize the sections of our life that we want to focus on using our knowledge, it would be how we can action in base of our knowledge to take a decision
- Life

#### MAPS
for each space we are going to use MAPS to take a overview of what we want to act on:
- MOCs
