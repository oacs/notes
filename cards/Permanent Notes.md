### Whats a permanent note
It is the refined version of fleeting and literature notes, they show how those raw notes connect to each other and what value bring us

A permanent note should be writing as if we need to show it to someone else:
- Full sentences
- Show the source of the info
- Precise, clear and brief as possible

They enable us to develop ideas, arguments and topics that interest us enought to make a piece of our wisdowm and write it into our Second Brain/[[Zettelkasten]]
