2. Add 250-500 calories to your daily caloric needs to gain weight
3. Incorporate strength training into your workout routine at least 2-3 times per week. Focus on compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, and bench press.
4. Eat a diet rich in protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Aim to consume 1-1.5 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight, and include plenty of complex carbohydrates like brown rice, sweet potatoes, and whole grain bread.
